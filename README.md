# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

For this project we analyzed the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.

For our analysis, we chose the Musical Instruments dataset of reviews.

The following tools were used for this analysis:

- PySpark: to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.
- Pandas: to determine if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in our dataset.
